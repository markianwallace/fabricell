fabriCELL is an open alliance of London researchers exploring Chemistry-Biology space in the creative design of artificial cellular devices. Our mission is to spur new thinking in biodesign; fusing living and non-living entities to build new compounds, cells and cell components for a new generation of intelligent materials.

1.	A New community

    a.	Become a focal point for London-based community addressing all aspects of artificial cell science.
    
    b.	Bring cohesion to emerging but currently fragmented landscape of artificial cell science and biohybrid design; adding value to the community and bring together stakeholders including scientists, engineers, medics, and industry.
    
2.	A New Research Approach

    a.	Lead innovative research in artificial synthetic and biophybrid cellular devices, devising new methodologies to address fundamental understanding and overcome barriers to innovation.
    
    b.	Bridge the gap between fundamental  investigation and new technologies and applications.
    
    c.	Secure funding for both Proof of Concept experiments and larger scale initiatives in artificial cell science.
    
    d.	Support horizon scanning workshops and creativity labs  to clearly identify and articulate the challenges facing artificial cell science, developing solutions and exploring applications.
    
    e.	Capitalise on bio-maker space community to drive innovation in this sector: increase pace of innovation.
    
3.	A New Generation of researchers

    a.	Generate future leaders with interdisciplinary training who are equipped to advance artificial cell science.
    
    b.	Develop new education at the interface of Biology, Physics, Chemistry, and Nanotechnology; leading to novel CDT/ITN/PhD training initiatives.
    
4.	Policy, communication and engagement

    a.	Engage the scientific community through a keynote seminar series combined with two-day focussed topic meetings.
    
    b.	Engage and inform policy makers/RCUK by leading on landscape white paper and roadmap for the area of artificial cell science.
    
    c.	Engage and educate public with public engagement programme and addressing concerns/view of public with respect to wide spread application of protocell technologies.
    
    d.	Engage industry and SMEs by acting as umbrella for applied collaborations in field of protocell science.
